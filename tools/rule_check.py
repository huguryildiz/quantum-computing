# The list is matched case-insensitively, so a phrase opening a sentence is
# caught as readily as one inside it. Write each pattern in lower case.
# Several patterns are narrower here than in the course this list came from,
# and all for one reason: the word means something technical in a quantum
# course, and banning it outright bans the subject.
#
# "source" is a physical emitter — a single-photon source, a heralded pair
# source, a microwave source. What R2 forbids is naming the material this
# artifact was written from, so the pattern matches only that sense: the source
# *document*, or a claim made about what "the source" says.
#
# "PDF" is a probability density function. What R2 forbids is naming a file, so
# the pattern needs the file sense: a .pdf extension, or the word "file" or
# "document" beside it. A gate that fires on the abbreviation would be turned
# off within a module, and a gate that is turned off checks nothing.
#
# "phase" is the subject of this course and cannot be banned in any form, so
# the build-process patterns below are bound to a build word rather than to a
# number: a bare `phase 2\b` fires on "phase 2\pi" and on "phase 2 rad".
